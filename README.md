# A-star_Path-Finding_Visualizar
A path finding visualizer tool to visualize the A star pathfinding algorithm as it runs.

A* pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which is much more efficient than standard algorithms like breadth first search or depth first search. It is an improved version of Dijkstra algorithm.
